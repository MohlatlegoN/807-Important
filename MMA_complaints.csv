If it is of the view that there is a prima facie breach of the Code, the IEC must refer the matter to the Electoral Court for the appropriate sanctions to be imposed by that Court.

I am sorry fellow South Africans. When I see scenes
like these, right within our borders, I don't just get
concerned, I get langry.
Our country's Sovereignty is compromised.
