    "## Text Classification - OneClass Classificaiton\n",
    "The one-class algorithms are based on recognition since their aim is to recognize data from a particular class, and reject data from all other classes. This is accomplished by creating a boundary that encompasses all the data belonging to the target class within itself, so when a new sample arrives the algorithm only has to check whether it lies within the boundary or outside and accordingly classify the sample as belonging to the target class or the outlier.\n",
