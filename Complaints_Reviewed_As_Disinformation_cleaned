The organized Rage events as marketed by a particular firm have not all taken place. The Jeffrey's Bay event he mentions was scheduled by a firm (Howler) who have since cancelled there event. However,the term rage and a matric rage is not trademarked or the domain of the organized events carrying that branding. Over the course of last week there was at least one rage party in Jeffrey's Bay. Dr Mkhize speaks of rage parties and even if there is a degree of miscommunication resulting in associating a specific series of events with something more generic the person in the video's approach is more misleading and inaccurate than any lost in translation effect from the general reporting.

This statement is based on reference to a statement made by Dr Anthony Fauci pertaining to PCR cycles over 35 as being junk science. The tweet author states that South Africa utilises a 38 (approximate) cycle system.   The complaint is that this is mis- or disinformation.,The tweet author is misquoting Dr Fauci. It is therefore misleading to suggest that amplification at more than 35 cycles is junk science and it is catagorically false to claim that What this means is that everything the government and media are telling,is nonsense,from cases to infections to deaths.   PCR tests can generate a measurable amount of a thing from a very tiny sample if given enough cycles to run. That truth plays into the narrative in terms of a positive test being returned when the person perhaps had been exposed and recovered without even realising they were sick.

There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccinations have caused the original coronavirus to mutate. As explained... by the World Health Organization (WHO),when a virus is spreading widely in a population and infecting many people,it is more likely to mutate. 'The more opportunities a virus has to spread,the more it replicates – and the more opportunities it has to undergo changes',” the WHO says.
